# Build Context Analysis

## Task Overview

Perform comprehensive context analysis before attempting to fix build errors to prevent regressions and technical debt introduction. This consolidated framework combines systematic investigation with validation checklists to ensure informed fixes rather than blind error resolution.

## Context

This analysis prevents developers from blindly "fixing" build errors without understanding why they exist and what functionality could be lost. It combines historical investigation, test contract analysis, dependency mapping, and risk assessment into a single comprehensive approach.

## Execution Approach

**CRITICAL BUILD CONTEXT VALIDATION** - This analysis addresses systematic "quick fix" behavior that introduces regressions.

1. **Investigate the history** - why did the build break?
2. **Understand the intended behavior** through tests
3. **Map all dependencies** and integration points  
4. **Plan fixes that preserve** existing functionality
5. **Create validation checkpoints** to catch regressions

The goal is informed fixes, not blind error resolution.

## Prerequisites

- Build errors identified and categorized
- Story requirements understood
- Access to git history and previous implementations
- Development environment configured for analysis
- **Execute lightweight-ide-detection.md first** to optimize tool usage

## Phase 1: Historical Context Investigation

### Git History Analysis

**Understand the story behind each build error:**

**For each build error category:**

- [ ] **Recent Changes Identified**: Found commits that introduced build errors
- [ ] **Git Blame Analysis**: Identify when interface/implementation diverged
- [ ] **Commit Message Review**: Understand the intent behind interface changes
- [ ] **Previous Implementation Review**: Study what the working code actually did
- [ ] **Interface Evolution Understood**: Know why interfaces changed vs implementations
- [ ] **Previous Working State Documented**: Have record of last working implementation
- [ ] **Change Intent Clarified**: Understand purpose of interface modifications
- [ ] **Business Logic Preserved**: Identified functionality that must be maintained
- [ ] **Change Justification**: Understand why the interface was modified

### Historical Analysis Process

**Execute git history analysis using environment-optimized approach:**

**Environment-Adaptive Git Analysis:**
- **If Cursor/Trae/Windsurf**: Use AI-powered git analysis with natural language queries
- **If Claude Code**: Use built-in git integration and diff visualization  
- **If Roo Code**: Use cloud git integration with collaborative history
- **If Cline/GitHub Copilot**: Use VS Code git panel with AI enhancement
- **If Gemini CLI**: Use CLI git with AI analysis
- **If Standalone**: Use bash commands with approval prompts

**Optimized Git Commands (Environment-Specific):**
```bash
# Single combined command to minimize approvals in CLI mode
echo "=== BMAD Build Context Analysis ===" && \
mkdir -p tmp && \
echo "=== Recent Commits ===" && git log --oneline -10 && \
echo "=== Interface Changes ===" && git log --oneline -20 --grep="interface|API|contract|signature" && \
echo "=== Frequently Modified Files ===" && git log --since="30 days ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

5. **Build Error Source Analysis:**
   - Examine source files for recent changes
   - Focus on files most likely causing build errors

**Key Git Investigation Commands to Execute:**

### Documentation Required

Document findings in the following format:

```markdown
## Build Error Context Analysis

### Error Category: [UserRole Constructor Issues - 50 errors]

#### Git History Investigation:

```

## Phase 2: Test Contract Analysis

### Existing Test Investigation
